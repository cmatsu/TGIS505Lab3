				<h3>What are Hexbins?</h3>
				<p>Picture any regular map that has a large set of point data. Now imagine there is some kind of gridded layer over it, where the grids are in the shape of a rectangle or hexagon. To put it simply, binning is a handy way of aggregating points that fall within a grid of such type of layer, and the quantities can be categorized and color coded the same way a choropleth map would be. </p>
				<p>However, when the grid is in the shape of a hexagon it is much more efficient at aggregating the data around the bin center because hexagons are structurally more similar to a circle than a square, and also because a single hexagon is adjacent to more grids compared to a single square.</p>
				<p>To demonstrate how much easier it is to visualize patterns in large point datasets using this method, USFS data for all fire occurrences recorded between 1984 and 2018 were used to showcase how hexbin mapping compares to mapping clustered point data.</p>

				<p>This map was created with a bin size of 75 miles.</p>
				<h3>What can we observe?</h3>
				<p>It is evident that
				There is a concentration of fires around Topeka, Kansas and Tulsa, Oklahoma.
				Another prominent hotspot is Florida as a whole,</p>
				<p>Next, let's take a look at a hexbin map that focuses on the state of Florida.</p>
